This is the matlab code of NPQI proposed in the following paper:

Yutao Liu, Ke Gu, Xiu Li, and Yongbing Zhang, Blind Image Quality Assessment by Natural Scene Statistics and Perceptual Characteristics. ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. 16, 3, Article 91 (September 2020), 91 pages. 

NPQI is designed to measure the image quality with arbitrary distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six standard image databases verify that it outperforms the most popular NIQE method by a large margin in predicting the perceptual image quality. It's also highly efficient for use.
